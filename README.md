## Instructions

- (*Skip to the bottom note if you have problems extracting core or just prefer to avoid the potential issue*) 

- First install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) LTS before installing [BandagedBD](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/releases) from the releases page and restart.

- Next go to themes in your discord settings and click "open theme folder"

- Drag TransientMaterial.theme.css from the TransientMaterial folder to your themes folder.

- Press Ctrl+R in discord to restart and go back to user settings to toggle the theme.

- Profit??

## Note

- Background can be changed by editing the url in TransientMaterial.theme.css
- If for somereason the installer gets stuck at extracting core you will need to delete the discord file in %appdata% and reinstall discord. After you've done that to fix this problem is download [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.11.2/node-v8.11.2-win-x64.zip) from here and put BandagedBD.exe into the folder you extracted before running it again.
